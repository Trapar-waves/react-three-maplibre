> A React-based library integrating Three.js, MapLibre, and AntV for advanced geospatial 3D visualizations.

## ✨ Features

* **Geospatial Visualization:** Combines `@antv/l7` and `maplibre-gl` for powerful geospatial data rendering with custom map layers.
* **3D Rendering with React:** Leverages `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` to integrate Three.js into a React-based workflow for declarative 3D scene management.
* **Customizable UI Integration:** Offers seamless integration with React (`react`, `react-dom`) for building interactive geospatial applications.
* **Utility-First Styling:** Employs `tailwindcss` for flexible and rapid styling of components and layouts.
* **Type Safety:** Uses TypeScript to ensure type safety and improve developer experience during development.
* **Fast Development Workflow:** Utilizes `rsbuild` for optimized builds and efficient development server performance.
* **Rich Component Library:** Integrates with `three-stdlib` and `@react-three/drei` for reusable Three.js utilities and components.
* **Map Interactivity:** Implements `react-map-gl` for interactive map controls and client-side navigation in geospatial contexts.
* **AntV Enhancements:** Incorporates `@antv/l7-maps` for additional map layering capabilities and visualization tools.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running locally.

### Prerequisites

* Ensure you have the following installed:
