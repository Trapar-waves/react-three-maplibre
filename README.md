> A React-based library integrating Three.js, MapLibre, and AntV for advanced geospatial 3D visualizations.

## ✨ Features

- **Geospatial Visualization:** Combines `@antv/l7` and `maplibre-gl` for powerful geospatial data rendering with custom map layers.
- **3D Rendering with React:** Leverages `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` to integrate Three.js into a React-based workflow for declarative 3D scene management.
- **Customizable UI Integration:** Offers seamless integration with React (`react`, `react-dom`) for building interactive geospatial applications.
- **Utility-First Styling:** Employs `tailwindcss` for flexible and rapid styling of components and layouts.
- **Type Safety:** Uses TypeScript to ensure type safety and improve developer experience during development.
- **Fast Development Workflow:** Utilizes `rsbuild` for optimized builds and efficient development server performance.
- **Rich Component Library:** Integrates with `three-stdlib` and `@react-three/drei` for reusable Three.js utilities and components.
- **Map Interactivity:** Implements `react-map-gl` for interactive map controls and client-side navigation in geospatial contexts.
- **AntV Enhancements:** Incorporates `@antv/l7-maps` for additional map layering capabilities and visualization tools.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Framework/Library:** React
- **UI Toolkit/Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **3D Rendering:** Three.js (`@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`)
- **Geospatial Libraries:** MapLibre GL, AntV L7
- **Build Tool:** Rsbuild
